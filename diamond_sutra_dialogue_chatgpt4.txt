Do you know 金剛般若波羅密經?

ChatGPT
Yes, the 金剛般若波羅蜜經, often translated as the "Diamond Sutra," is a Mahayana Buddhist sutra from the Prajñāpāramitā (Perfection of Wisdom) texts. It is known for its profound teachings on emptiness and the concept of non-attachment. The title itself can be broken down into several parts: "金剛" (vajra in Sanskrit, meaning diamond or thunderbolt) symbolizes something indestructible, "般若" (prajñā) means wisdom, "波羅蜜" (pāramitā) refers to perfection, and "經" indicates a sutra or scripture. Thus, the Diamond Sutra can be understood as "The Perfection of Wisdom Sutra that is Like a Diamond."

The Diamond Sutra is considered one of the most important texts in Zen Buddhism and Mahayana tradition for its teachings on the nature of reality and the concept of sunyata (emptiness). It is known for its dialogues between the Buddha and his disciple Subhuti, discussing themes such as the impermanence of phenomena and the idea that all composite things are not ultimately real.

The text is famous for its doctrine of non-attachment, epitomized in the phrase often paraphrased as, "Thus shall you think of all this fleeting world: a star at dawn, a bubble in a stream; a flash of lightning in a summer cloud, a flickering lamp, a phantom, and a dream."

The Diamond Sutra has a significant historical and cultural impact, with its teachings influencing various aspects of Buddhist thought and practice. It is also notable for its early printed edition, the Dunhuang manuscript, which is considered the world's earliest dated printed book, printed in 868 AD during the Tang Dynasty in China.

Good. Then, please answer the question below using your knowledge about 金剛般若波羅密經.

One monk, who studied well about 金剛般若波羅密經, went to trip then meet a old lady who sells lunch. The monk asked to buy lunch(點心 in chinese) from the old lady. The lady said that she will sell the lunch to him if he can answer her question about 金剛般若波羅密經. So the monk accepted the challenge. Old lady's question is this; "Accoding to 金剛般若波羅密經, 過去心 不可得, 現在心 不可得, 未來心 不可得. 未審上座點個心? "

Question: What answer the monk would give to her, according to 金剛般若波羅密經?

ChatGPT:
Given the context of the Diamond Sutra's teachings and the clever play on words in the old lady's question, especially with the use of "點心" (which can mean both "dim sum" and "point of mind"), a monk well-versed in the Diamond Sutra might respond in a way that reflects the profound understanding of non-attachment and the essence of mind in Buddhist philosophy.

A possible answer that aligns with the teachings of the Diamond Sutra could be:

"The mind that neither clings to the past, present, nor future is the mind that will partake in the meal. Just as the Diamond Sutra teaches that all phenomena are like a dream, an illusion, a bubble, and a shadow, so too is the nature of the mind that seeks to grasp them. Thus, I will use the mind that abides in no place - the very mind that sees the emptiness of all dharmas - to eat the lunch you offer."

This answer encapsulates the essence of the teachings on emptiness and the non-abiding nature of the mind, as discussed in the Diamond Sutra. It reflects an understanding that the true nature of the mind is not to be found in clinging to any conception of past, present, or future, but rather in realizing the inherent emptiness of all experiences and phenomena. By pointing to a mind that "abides in no place," the monk conveys the insight that true freedom and the basis for enlightened action lie in non-attachment and the direct perception of the nature of reality as taught by the Buddha in the Diamond Sutra.

From your answer, the lady can reply like this; "How can you use the mind that abides in no place? Such a mind does not exists since  it is nowhere. So, I cannot provide you lunch(點心), since the point of mind(點心) exists nowhere."

ChatGPT
In the spirit of the Diamond Sutra and the depth of Zen Buddhist teaching reflected in the old lady's clever retort, the monk might respond with an answer that both embraces the paradox and goes beyond the conventional understanding of existence and non-existence, presence and absence. A response that captures the essence of the teachings might be:

"Exactly so, respected elder. Just as the mind that abides nowhere does not cling to existence or non-existence, so too does the true nature of all things, including the act of eating lunch, transcend the boundaries of being and not-being. The Diamond Sutra teaches us to see beyond the dualities that bind us. In realizing the emptiness of all phenomena, we engage with the world not through the illusions of the mind that seeks to grasp or reject, but with the wisdom that knows the middle way. Therefore, in the understanding that both the lunch and the mind that would partake of it are expressions of emptiness, the act of eating becomes a practice of non-attachment and insight. In this way, the true 'point of mind' is the practice of wisdom itself, which is no practice, and the lunch that is not given is the very sustenance of enlightenment."

This response is a reflection on the profound teachings of the Diamond Sutra, emphasizing the practice of non-attachment, the realization of emptiness, and the understanding that the ultimate truth lies beyond conceptual dichotomies. It illustrates the Zen principle of using everyday actions as a means of manifesting deep understanding and enlightenment, embodying the sutra's teachings in the very act of living.

Indeed, for your information, it is an anecdote of 德山宣鑑. In the anecdote, he could not answer the lady's question, so he didn't get the lunch from the lady. What do you think about this?

ChatGPT
The anecdote involving 德山宣鑑 (Deshan Xuanjian), a prominent figure in Zen Buddhism, who was stumped by the old lady's question and consequently couldn't receive the lunch, is a fascinating illustration of several core Zen principles and teachings. Here are a few reflections on the significance of this story:

1. Humility and the Learning Process: The story underscores the importance of humility in the spiritual journey. Despite Deshan's deep scholarly understanding of Buddhist texts, including the Diamond Sutra, the encounter with the old lady highlights that intellectual knowledge alone is not sufficient for true understanding. This encounter serves as a reminder that wisdom is not solely acquired through study but also through direct experience and the ability to apply teachings in everyday life.

2. Non-attachment to Knowledge: Deshan's inability to answer the lady's question also reflects the Zen teaching of non-attachment, not only to physical things but also to ideas and concepts, including one's knowledge and understanding of Buddhist teachings. It illustrates the pitfall of clinging to intellectual understanding and the necessity of transcending it to realize the deeper, experiential truth that Zen points to.

3. The Role of Everyday Encounters in Enlightenment: The story highlights how everyday encounters and seemingly mundane interactions can be profound opportunities for insight and awakening. Zen teachings often emphasize that enlightenment is not separate from daily life but intimately connected with ordinary activities, like eating lunch or conversing with a stranger.

4. The Use of Koans in Zen Practice: The old lady's question can be seen as a form of koan, a paradoxical statement or question used in Zen practice to confound the logical mind and facilitate direct insight into the nature of reality. Deshan's encounter with the old lady exemplifies how koans function to challenge and deepen one's understanding.

5. Continual Growth and Awakening: The story of Deshan doesn't end with his failure to answer the old lady's question. It is part of his larger spiritual journey, which involves moments of insight, humility, and transformation. His inability to get lunch from the lady is a pivotal moment that contributes to his ongoing process of awakening and illustrates that the path to enlightenment is an ongoing journey rather than a destination.

This anecdote beautifully encapsulates the essence of Zen: enlightenment is not found in the accumulation of knowledge but in the ability to live fully in each moment, free from attachment, and in the direct experience of reality as it is. It teaches that wisdom and insight can come from the most unexpected sources and that every encounter is an opportunity for learning and growth.
